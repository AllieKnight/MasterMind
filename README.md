# MasterMind
Java Implementation of the game Mastermind. 
Developed in the NetBeans IDE, it is meant to be run from the IDE. When run, the code creates a JPanel with the Mastermind game, who's answer is randomized in each play session, and which features a menu bar to aid the player. The code has not currently been exported to run outside of the NetBeans IDE
